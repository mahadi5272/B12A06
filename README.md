## 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
 Here’s a concise answer in English:
A:  var: Function-scoped, can be redeclared and updated.

B: let: Block-scoped, can be updated but cannot be redeclared in the same scope.

C: const: Block-scoped, cannot be redeclared or updated (the value is constant).

## 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
Here’s a concise explanation in English:

forEach()

Loops over an array and executes a function on each element.

Does not return anything (undefined).

Use it when you just want to perform side effects (like logging).

## 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
Arrow functions are a compact way to write functions and handle this differently than normal functions.

## 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Destructuring lets you unpack values from arrays or objects directly into variables, making code shorter and cleaner.

## 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Template literals are basically a cleaner, smarter way to handle strings in ES6.
